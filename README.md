# leaflet-challenge

## Description
This project involves creating an interactive map to visualize earthquake data. The map utilizes Leaflet, a JavaScript library for interactive maps, and fetches real-time earthquake data from the USGS GeoJSON Feed. It features markers representing earthquakes, varying in size according to their magnitude and color-coded based on their depth. Additionally, the map includes a legend for understanding the depth representation and interactive popups for detailed information about each earthquake.

## Features
- Interactive map with zoom and pan functionality.
- Earthquake markers sized by magnitude.
- Color-coded markers based on earthquake depth.
- Popups with detailed earthquake information.
- A legend explaining the depth color coding.
